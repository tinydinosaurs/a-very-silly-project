# A Very Silly Project

This project is really a collection of mini projects using React and various other things. It's a way to keep writing code I enjoy while I'm busy at work debugging and otherwise not working on particularly satisfying projects.

Run it if you want, but be prepared. The name of the project is not a hyperbole.

## Running the Project

-   Clone this repository
-   `yarn install` the dependencies
-   `yarn start` and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The "notes" page of the projects uses JSON server to simulate an external database. If you want to send or retrieve notes, run `npm run server`. To see the JSON data, navigate to [http://localhost:3001/notes](http://localhost:3001/notes)

## Testing the Project

There aren't any tests yet. I'll get there eventually.

## Building the project

Don't yet, plz.

## Project Dependencies

What I've used to build this thing so far.

### Bootstrapping

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is much easier than building a React app from scratch. It's certainly worth it to build one from scratch every so often, but it wasn't worth it for this silly, silly project.

### Other Dependencies

-   JSON server
-   React Testing Library
